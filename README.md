#snakeRPG 
 
>snakeRPG is a multiplayer snake game, with some RPG element included in it. It's in very early developpement. 
 
Projet réalisé dans le cadre de nos études en Master 1 Informatique à l'Université d'Angers. 
 
This is the repo for the client component. For the server component, see a repo that does not yet exist. 
Like i said, it's in early developpement. 
 
##Library 
 
[libGdx](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) for all the view stuff 
 
[Guava](https://github.com/google/guava) for some collection type (multimap) 
 
#Getting started 
 
This project use gradle as it build system, and use the default [libgdx structure](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Creating%20Projects.html#structure-of-libgdx-projects) 
We only target desktop for now. 
 
[How to import the project into your favorite IDE.](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/documentation/gettingstarted/Importing%20into%20IDE.html) 
 
To build the project : 
 
`./gradlew build` (duh) 
 
##Status 
 
This is still in early developement. Since it's a university project, we're not even sure it's gonna have some kind of release one day. 
 
For now we're focusing on having a single player client only version, so we can be sure our vision for the game engine can works. We'll work on the multiplayer part later. 
 
This is not really open for contribution : as said earlier, it's a university project so we want to do most of it on our own. However we're open to any good idea or critics you may have :)
